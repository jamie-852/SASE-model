'SampledParameters_Apr2023.csv' shows the 1 million parameter sets generated using g_samples.m.
Each column represents one parameter.
  
'AllSteadyStates.csv' shows all the steady states found from each sampled parameter using 
'a_SampledParameters.m'.
  
'AllVirtualPatients.csv' shows numbered unique parameters set so that we can see how many 
virtual skin sites are present and how many stable states each of them have. 

'rev_SAkilling.csv' and 'irrev_SAkilling.csv' are the isolated damaged skin states 
that we applied SA-killing to.

'rev_SAkilling_DA.csv' and 'irrev_SAkilling_DA.csv' are the isolated damaged skin states
that we applied SA-killing to after bacterial growth attenuation was enhanced by 20-fold.
