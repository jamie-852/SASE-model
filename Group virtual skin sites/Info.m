%% g_PatientTypes_1.m, g_PatientTypes_2.m and g_PatientTypes_3.m
% extract virtual skin sites with one, two or three stable steady states
% respectively. we group plots together based on the number of stable
% steady states and the characteristic population densities of SA and SE as
% seen in supplementary note 3.
